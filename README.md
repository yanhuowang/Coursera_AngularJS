This repository contains 5 projects:

## 1. Check If Too Much
A front-end application that presents the user with a textbox where they can list comma-separated items they usually eat for lunch. Once that's entered, the user has to click the "Check If Too Much" button. If the number of items in the textbox is less than or equal to 3 (e.g., 1, 2, or 3), a message  show up under to the textbox saying "Enjoy!". If the number of items is greater than 3 (4, 5, and above), the message "Too much!"  show up under the textbox.

Practice: Scopes, Dependency Injection.

## 3. Narrow It Down
For the user to search the descriptions of menu items. Then, given the list of matches of his search, give the user the ability to throw the items they for sure don't want off the list, thus narrowing it down to what they do want.

Practice: Promises, $http Service, Custom Directives.
